.. py:class:: DaCapoArraySource(array: dacapo.experiments.datasplits.datasets.arrays.Array, key: gunpowder.ArrayKey)




   A DaCapo Array source node

   :param Array: The DaCapo Array to pull data from
   :type Array: Array
   :param key: The key to provide data into
   :type key: ``gp.ArrayKey``

   .. py:method:: setup()

      To be implemented in subclasses.

      Called during initialization of the DAG. Callees can assume that all
      upstream providers are set up already.

      In setup, call :func:`provides` to announce the arrays and points
      provided by this node.


   .. py:method:: provide(request)

      To be implemented in subclasses.

      This function takes a :class:`BatchRequest` and should return the
      corresponding :class:`Batch`.

      :param request: The request to process.
      :type request: :class:`BatchRequest`



.. py:class:: DaCapoTargetFilter(predictor: dacapo.experiments.tasks.predictors.Predictor, gt_key: gunpowder.ArrayKey, target_key: Optional[gunpowder.ArrayKey] = None, weights_key: Optional[gunpowder.ArrayKey] = None, mask_key: Optional[gunpowder.ArrayKey] = None)




   A Gunpowder node for generating the target from the ground truth

   :param Predictor: The DaCapo Predictor to use to transform gt into target
   :type Predictor: Predictor
   :param gt: The dataset to use for generating the target.
   :type gt: ``Array``
   :param target_key: The key with which to provide the target.
   :type target_key: ``gp.ArrayKey``

   .. py:method:: setup()

      To be implemented in subclasses.

      Called during initialization of the DAG. Callees can assume that all
      upstream providers are set up already.

      In setup, call :func:`provides` or :func:`updates` to announce the
      arrays and points provided or changed by this node.


   .. py:method:: prepare(request)

      To be implemented in subclasses.

      Prepare for a batch request. Should return a :class:`BatchRequest` of
      needed dependencies. If None is returned, it will be assumed that all
      of request is needed.


   .. py:method:: process(batch, request)

      To be implemented in subclasses.

      Filter a batch, will be called after :func:`prepare`. Should return a
      :class:`Batch` containing modified Arrays and Graphs. Keys in the returned
      batch will replace the associated data in the original batch. If None is
      returned it is assumed that the batch has been modified in place. ``request``
      is the same as passed to :func:`prepare`, provided for convenience.

      :param batch: The batch received from upstream to be modified by this node.
      :type batch: :class:`Batch`
      :param request: The request this node received. The updated batch should meet
                      this request.
      :type request: :class:`BatchRequest`



.. py:class:: GammaAugment(arrays, gamma_min, gamma_max)




   An Augment to apply gamma noise

   .. py:method:: setup()

      To be implemented in subclasses.

      Called during initialization of the DAG. Callees can assume that all
      upstream providers are set up already.

      In setup, call :func:`provides` or :func:`updates` to announce the
      arrays and points provided or changed by this node.


   .. py:method:: process(batch, request)

      To be implemented in subclasses.

      Filter a batch, will be called after :func:`prepare`. Should return a
      :class:`Batch` containing modified Arrays and Graphs. Keys in the returned
      batch will replace the associated data in the original batch. If None is
      returned it is assumed that the batch has been modified in place. ``request``
      is the same as passed to :func:`prepare`, provided for convenience.

      :param batch: The batch received from upstream to be modified by this node.
      :type batch: :class:`Batch`
      :param request: The request this node received. The updated batch should meet
                      this request.
      :type request: :class:`BatchRequest`



.. py:class:: ElasticAugment(control_point_spacing, control_point_displacement_sigma, rotation_interval, subsample=1, augmentation_probability=1.0, seed=None, uniform_3d_rotation=False)




   Elasticly deform a batch. Requests larger batches upstream to avoid data
   loss due to rotation and jitter.

   :param control_point_spacing: Distance between control points for the elastic deformation, in
                                 voxels per dimension.
   :type control_point_spacing: ``tuple`` of ``int``
   :param control_point_displacement_sigma: Standard deviation of control point displacement distribution, in world coordinates.
   :type control_point_displacement_sigma: ``tuple`` of ``float``
   :param rotation_interval: Interval to randomly sample rotation angles from (0, 2PI).
   :type rotation_interval: ``tuple`` of two ``floats``
   :param subsample: Instead of creating an elastic transformation on the full
                     resolution, create one sub-sampled by the given factor, and linearly
                     interpolate to obtain the full resolution transformation. This can
                     significantly speed up this node, at the expense of having visible
                     piecewise linear deformations for large factors. Usually, a factor
                     of 4 can safely be used without noticeable changes. However, the
                     default is 1 (i.e., no sub-sampling).
   :type subsample: ``int``
   :param seed: Set random state for reproducible results (tests only, do not use
                in production code!!)
   :type seed: ``int``

.. py:class:: GraphSource(key: gunpowder.GraphKey, graph: gunpowder.Graph)




   Superclass for all nodes in a `gunpowder` graph.

   A :class:`BatchProvider` provides :class:`Batches<Batch>` containing
   :class:`Arrays<Array>` and/or :class:`Graph`. The available data is
   specified in a :class:`ProviderSpec` instance, accessible via :attr:`spec`.

   To create a new node, subclass this class and implement (at least)
   :func:`setup` and :func:`provide`.

   A :class:`BatchProvider` can be linked to any number of other
   :class:`BatchProviders<BatchProvider>` upstream. If your node accepts
   exactly one upstream provider, consider subclassing :class:`BatchFilter`
   instead.
