   An Augment to apply gamma noise

   .. py:method:: setup()

      To be implemented in subclasses.

      Called during initialization of the DAG. Callees can assume that all
      upstream providers are set up already.

      In setup, call :func:`provides` or :func:`updates` to announce the
      arrays and points provided or changed by this node.


   .. py:method:: process(batch, request)

      To be implemented in subclasses.

      Filter a batch, will be called after :func:`prepare`. Should return a
      :class:`Batch` containing modified Arrays and Graphs. Keys in the returned
      batch will replace the associated data in the original batch. If None is
      returned it is assumed that the batch has been modified in place. ``request``
      is the same as passed to :func:`prepare`, provided for convenience.

      :param batch: The batch received from upstream to be modified by this node.
      :type batch: :class:`Batch`
      :param request: The request this node received. The updated batch should meet
                      this request.
      :type request: :class:`BatchRequest`
