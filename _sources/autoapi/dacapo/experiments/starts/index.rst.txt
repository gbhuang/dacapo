.. py:class:: Start(start_config)




   This class interfaces with the dacapo store to retrieve and load the
   weights of the starter model used for finetuning.

   .. attribute:: run

      The specified run to retrieve weights for the model.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: criterion

      The policy that was used to decide when to store the weights.

      :type: str

   .. py:method:: initialize_weights(model, new_head=None)

      Retrieves the weights from the dacapo store and load them into
      the model.
      :param model: The model to which the weights are to be loaded.
      :type model: obj

      :raises RuntimeError: If weights of a non-existing or mismatched layer are being
          loaded, a RuntimeError exception is thrown which is logged
          and handled by loading only the common layers from weights.



.. py:class:: StartConfig


   A class to represent the configuration for running tasks.

   .. attribute:: run

      The run to be used as a starting point for tasks.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: criterion

      The criterion to be used for choosing weights from run.

.. py:class:: CosemStart(start_config)




   This class interfaces with the dacapo store to retrieve and load the
   weights of the starter model used for finetuning.

   .. attribute:: run

      The specified run to retrieve weights for the model.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: criterion

      The policy that was used to decide when to store the weights.

      :type: str

   .. py:method:: check()


   .. py:method:: initialize_weights(model, new_head=None)

      Retrieves the weights from the dacapo store and load them into
      the model.
      :param model: The model to which the weights are to be loaded.
      :type model: obj

      :raises RuntimeError: If weights of a non-existing or mismatched layer are being
          loaded, a RuntimeError exception is thrown which is logged
          and handled by loading only the common layers from weights.



.. py:class:: CosemStartConfig




   Starter for COSEM pretained models. This is a subclass of `StartConfig` and
   should be used to initialize the model with pretrained weights from a previous
   run.
