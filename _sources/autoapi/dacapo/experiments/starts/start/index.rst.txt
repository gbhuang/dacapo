   This class interfaces with the dacapo store to retrieve and load the
   weights of a model.

   .. attribute:: run

      The specified run to retrieve weights for the model.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: criterion

      The policy that was used to decide when to store the weights.

   .. py:method:: initialize_weights(model)

      Retrieves the weights from the dacapo store and load them into
      the model.

      :param model: The model to which the weights are to be loaded.
      :type model: obj

      :raises RuntimeError: If weights of a non-existing or mismatched layer are being
          loaded, a RuntimeError exception is thrown which is logged
          and handled by loading only the common layers from weights.
