.. py:class:: DummyLoss




   A class representing a dummy loss function that calculates the absolute difference between each prediction and target.

   Inherits the Loss class.

   .. method:: compute(prediction, target, weight=None)

      Calculate the total loss between prediction and target.


   .. py:method:: compute(prediction, target, weight=None)

      Method to calculate the total dummy loss.

      :param prediction: predicted output
      :type prediction: float or int
      :param target: true output
      :type target: float or int
      :param weight: weight parameter for the loss, by default None
      :type weight: float or int, optional

      :returns: Total loss calculated as the sum of absolute differences between prediction and target.
      :rtype: float or int



.. py:class:: MSELoss




   A class used to represent the Mean Square Error Loss function (MSELoss).

   .. attribute:: None



   .. method:: compute(prediction, target, weight):

      Computes the MSELoss with the given weight for the predictiom and target.


   .. py:method:: compute(prediction, target, weight)

      Function to compute the MSELoss for the provided prediction and target, with respect to the weight.

      Parameters:
      ----------
      prediction : torch.Tensor
          The prediction tensor for which loss needs to be calculated.
      target : torch.Tensor
          The target tensor with respect to which loss is calculated.
      weight : torch.Tensor
          The weight tensor used to weigh the prediction in the loss calculation.

      Returns:
      -------
      :
      torch.Tensor
          The computed MSELoss tensor.



.. py:class:: Loss




   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

   .. py:method:: compute(prediction: torch.Tensor, target: torch.Tensor, weight: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None) -> torch.Tensor
      :abstractmethod:

      Compute the loss for the given prediction and target. Optionally, if
      given, a loss weight should be considered.

      All arguments are ``torch`` tensors. The return type should be a
      ``torch`` scalar that can be used with an optimizer, just as usual when
      training with ``torch``.



.. py:class:: AffinitiesLoss(num_affinities: int, lsds_to_affs_weight_ratio: float)




   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

   .. py:method:: compute(prediction, target, weight)

      Compute the loss for the given prediction and target. Optionally, if
      given, a loss weight should be considered.

      All arguments are ``torch`` tensors. The return type should be a
      ``torch`` scalar that can be used with an optimizer, just as usual when
      training with ``torch``.



.. py:class:: HotDistanceLoss




   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

   .. py:method:: compute(prediction, target, weight)

      Compute the loss for the given prediction and target. Optionally, if
      given, a loss weight should be considered.

      All arguments are ``torch`` tensors. The return type should be a
      ``torch`` scalar that can be used with an optimizer, just as usual when
      training with ``torch``.
